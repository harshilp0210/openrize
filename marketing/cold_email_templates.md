Here are 3 distinct strategies for reaching out to local businesses. Choose the one that fits the specific prospect best.

## Strategy 1: The "Free Audit" Approach (Value-First)

**Subject:** Quick question about {Business Name}'s website
**Subject (Alternative):** {Business Name} on Google

Hi {Name},

I was looking for a place to eat in Elk Grove Village and came across {Business Name} on Google Maps.

I noticed you have a great 4.8-star rating (congrats!), but I saw two things that might be costing you customers:

1. Your website loads a bit slow on mobile (where 80% of specific food searches happen).
2. You haven't had a new Google review in a few weeks.

I run search audits for local businesses and I made a quick video showing exactly how you can fix this in 5 minutes.

Mind if I send it over? No pitch, just wanted to share the findings.

Best,

## Strategy 2: The "POS / System" Approach (Problem Solving)

**Subject:** Saving 2 hours a week at {Business Name}?

Hi {Name},

I know running a restaurant involves a million things, specifically inventory and payroll.

My name is [Your Name] and I help Illinois restaurants automate the boring stuff. We recently helped a local cafe reduce their end-of-day closing time by 45 minutes just by switching to a smarter POS setup.

I’m local to Elk Grove Village. Would you be open to a 5-minute chat to see if our system could save you time too?

If not, no worries at all.

Cheers,

## Strategy 3: The "Website Redesign" Approach (Direct)

**Subject:** Refreshing {Business Name}'s online look

Hi {Name},

I’m a local web developer right here in Elk Grove Village.

I love {Business Name}'s vibe, but honestly, your website doesn't do your food justice. It feels a bit outdated compared to some of the new spots opening up downtown.

I’d love to design a **free mockup** of what a modern, high-converting homepage could look like for you.

If you hate it, you can scrap it. If you love it, we can talk about building it.

Interested in seeing what I can come up with?

Best,

[Your Name]

## ⚡ Cold Emailing Rules for Success

1.  **Don't Sell, Start a Conversation:** The goal of email #1 is just to get a "Yes, send me info" – not to get a check.
2.  **Follow Up:** 60% of leads come from the follow-up. Send a gentle nudge 3 days later ("Hi {Name}, just bumping this to the top of your inbox...").
3.  **Personalize:** Mention something specific (their rating, a specific dish, their location) so they know it's not a bot.
4.  **Keep it Short:** If it takes more than 10 seconds to read, it's too long.
