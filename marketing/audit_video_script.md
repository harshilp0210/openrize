# 🎥 The "Free Audit" Video Script

**Context:** You sent the "Strategy 1" email. The client replied "Sure, send me the video". Now you need to record a 2-3 minute video using Loom.com or similar.

**Goal:** Prove you are smart, helpful, and NOT a generic salesperson.

## The Setup

2.  Open their **Website** in another tab.
3.  Open a **Competitor's** listing (who is ranking higher than them) in a third tab.
4.  Start recording your screen.

## The Script

### 1. The Intro (0:00 - 0:30)
"Hey [Owner Name], thanks for letting me send this over. My name is [Your Name], I'm actually right down the road in Elk Grove."

"I don't want to waste your time, so I'm going to show you exactly what I found that's causing [Business Name] to miss out on some customers this week."

### 2. The Problem (0:30 - 1:30)
*(Switch to their Google Maps tab)*

"So first, I looked at your Google reviews. You have a great rating (4.8 stars), which is awesome. **BUT**, look at this..."

*(Point to the 'Newest' sort)*

"Your last review was from [Date]. Google's algorithm loves 'freshness'. If you don't get consistent reviews, they start pushing down your ranking."

*(Switch to Competitor tab)*
"Compare that to [Competitor Name]. They have fewer stars, but they got 3 reviews *this week*. That's why they are showing up above you when I search for 'Italian Restaurant'."

### 3. The Website Check (1:30 - 2:00)
*(Switch to their Website tab - Bonus points if you use specific 'Inspect Element' mobile view to show it looks bad on phone)*

"Also, I noticed on your website here... there is no easy button for me to 'Order Online' or 'Book a Table' right at the top. On mobile, people scroll for like 3 seconds before they leave. We need to put a big button right HERE."

### 4. The Solution / "How We Do It" (2:00 - 2:30)
"This is exactly what I help businesses with."

"I build systems that:
1.  Automatically text your customers after they eat to ask for a review (so you get 5-10 new reviews a week).
2.  Update this website so it captures every single visitor."

### 5. The Close (2:30 - End)
"I'm not trying to sell you some expensive package. I just want to fix these specific things for you."

"If you want to know how that works, just reply to this email or shoot me a text at [Your Phone Number]. I can pop by the restaurant sometime next week to show you."

"Thanks [Owner Name]!"

## 💡 Pro Tips
*   **Don't be perfect:** Stumbling over a word makes you sound real. Don't re-record 10 times.
*   **Keep it moving:** Don't stay on one screen for too long.
*   **Smile:** They can hear it in your voice.
